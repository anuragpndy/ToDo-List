# TO-DO-List :-
              An application to keep track of your daily tasks. I have made this project with HTML, CSS and JS.
              I have also added some functionalities to it like:-
                --> Clear all completed tasks in one go.
                --> Mark all tasks as completed.
                --> Filter tasks according to their status(All-tasks, Completed-tasks, Uncompleted-tasks).
                --> It also has a count to keep track of number of tasks in the list.
